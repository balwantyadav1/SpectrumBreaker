## ‚öô How the 2.4GHz Jammer Works

### üì° Technical Insight:

The *NRF24L01 module, though originally designed for short-range data transfer, can be **misused to flood the 2.4GHz spectrum* by sending random packets or bursts of data at high rates. Here's how it works:

1. *Channel Selection:*  
   The 2.4GHz ISM band (used by Wi-Fi, BLE, ZigBee) ranges from *2400 MHz to 2483.5 MHz, divided into **13 channels for Wi-Fi (in most regions)*.

2. *Noise Generation:*  
   The NRF24L01 can be programmed to transmit continuously on any of these channels. It sends *malformed packets or random bytes* repeatedly, overwhelming legitimate packets.

3. *Interference Behavior:*  
   This causes:
   - Wi-Fi packets to be corrupted or dropped
   - BLE advertisements to get lost
   - ZigBee communications to slow or fail
   - General 2.4GHz chaos in the area

4. *Multi-Module Parallel Jamming:*  
   Using 3 NRF24 modules allows the tool to *jam multiple channels simultaneously*, making it more effective and harder to counter.

5. *Detection Resistance:*  
   No real MAC is used during noise transmission. Makes it hard to trace and identify via standard sniffing tools.
